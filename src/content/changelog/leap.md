## Autocomplete Feature Experimentation

In our ongoing efforts to enhance user interaction and experience, we're excited to introduce a new experimentation phase featuring the **discord.js@14** [`AutocompleteInteraction`](https://old.discordjs.dev/#/docs/discord.js/14.14.1/class/AutocompleteInteraction).
This cutting-edge feature represents a significant step forward in providing more seamless and intuitive interactions.
